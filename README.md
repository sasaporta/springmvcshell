Dec 19 2013

This is an updated version of [mkyong's excellent Spring 3 MVC Hello World Example](http://www.mkyong.com/spring3/spring-3-mvc-hello-world-example/). My version includes a few enhancements:
- Works out of the box with Eclipse Juno and Tomcat 7
- Maven standard directory structure
- Spring version 4.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT rather than 3.0.5.RELEASE
- No need to append "welcome" to the URL to see the "hello world" page
- Project and classpath settings work with Tomcat 7 and Java 1.7
